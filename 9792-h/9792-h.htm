<h3><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>

<p class="normal">After making a production of <i>Redemption</i>, the chief
feeling of the producer is one of deep regret that Tolstoi did not
make more use of the theatre as a medium. His was the rare gift of
vitalization: the ability to breathe life into word-people which
survives in them so long as there is any one left to turn up the
pages they have made their abode.</p>

<p class="normal">In the world of writing, many terms that should be illuminative
have become meaningless. So often has the barren been called
"pregnant," the chill of death "the breath of life," the atrophied
"pulsating," that when we really come upon a work with beating
heart we find it difficult to give it place that has not already
been stuffed to suffocation with misplaced dummies.</p>

<p class="normal">We seat it at table with staring wax figures and bid it to join
the feast. There is no exclusion act in art, no passport bureau,
not even hygienic segregation.</p>

<p class="normal">In writing the briefest introduction to Tolstoi's work, I am
appointed by the publisher, a sort of reception committee of one to
escort the work to some fitting place where it may enjoy the
surroundings and deference it deserves.</p>

<p class="normal">The place to which I escort it is built of words, but what words
have been left me by the long procession of previous committees?
Where they have been truthfully used they have been glorified, and
offer all the rarer material for my structure, but how often have
they been subjected to base use. Perhaps some day we will learn the
proper respect of such simple words as love and truth and life, and
then when we meet them in books we shall know how to greet
them.</p>

<p class="normal">The study of <i>Redemption</i> is so simple that it needs no
illumination from me. The characters may walk in strange lands
without introduction. They are part of us. F&eacute;dya is in all
of us. His one cry "There has always been so much lacking between
what I felt and what I could do" instantly makes him brother to all
mankind. His simultaneous physical degeneration and spiritual
regeneration is the glory that all people have invested in death.
Tolstoi's cry against convention that disregards spiritual
struggle, and system that ignores human growth, will find answering
cries in many breasts in many lands.</p>

<p class="normal">Utterly disregarding effect, technique or method, Tolstoi has
explored his own soul and there touched hands with countless other
souls, and since he has trod the path of countless millions who
will come after him, the mementos of his journey will long be
sought.</p>

<p class="normal">The translation of <i>Redemption</i> here published is the one
produced by Mr. Arthur Hopkins at the Plymouth Theatre, New York,
in the season of 1918-1919. The part of F&Eacute;DYA was played by
Mr. John Barrymore.</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="hang"><i>Protosovs' flat in Moscow. The scene represents
a small dining room.</i> ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA<i>, a stout,
gray-haired lady, tightly laced, is sitting alone at the tea-table
on which is a samov&aacute;r.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Enter</i> NURSE <i>carrying a tea-pot.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nurse</i> (<i>enters R. I, over to table
C.</i>). Please, Madam, may I have some water?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i> (<i>sitting R. of table
C.</i>). Certainly. How is the baby now?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nurse.</i> Oh, restless, fretting all the time.
There's nothing worse than for a lady to nurse her child. She has
her worries and the baby suffers for them. What sort of milk could
she have, not peeping all night, and crying and crying?</p>

<p class="indent">[SASHA <i>enters R. I, strolls to L. of table
C.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> But I thought she was more calm
now?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nurse.</i> Fine calm! It makes me sick to look at her. She's
just been writing something and crying all the time.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i> (<i>to nurse</i>). Lisa's looking for you.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Sits in chair L. of table C.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nurse.</i> I'm going.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Exits R. I.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> Nurse says she's
always crying. Why can't she try and calm herself a little?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha.</i> Well, really, Mother, you're amazing.
How can you expect her to behave as if nothing had happened when
she's just left her husband and taken her baby with her?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> Well, I don't exactly,
but that's all over. If I approve of my daughter's having left her
husband, if I'm ever glad, well, you may be quite sure he deserved
it. She has no reason to be miserable&mdash;on the contrary, she ought
to be delighted at being freed from such a wretch.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Mother! Why do you go on like this?
It's not the truth and you know it. He's not a wretch, he's
wonderful. Yes, in spite of all his weakness.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. I suppose you'd like
her to wait till he'd spent every kopec they had, and smile sweetly
when be brought his gypsy mistresses home with him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. He hasn't any mistresses.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. There you go again.
Why, the man's simply bewitched you, but I can see through him, and
he knows it. If I'd been Lisa, I'd left him a year ago.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Oh, how easily you speak of these
serious things.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Not easily, not easily
at all. Do you suppose it's agreeable for me to have my daughter
admit her marriage a failure? But anything's better than for her to
throw away her life in a lie. Thank God, she's made up her mind to
finish with him for good.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Maybe it won't be for good.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. It would be if only
he'd give her a divorce.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. To what end?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Because she's young
and has the right to look for happiness.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. It's awful to listen to you. How
could she love some one else?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Why not? There are
thousands better than your F&eacute;dya, and they'd be only too
happy to marry Lisa.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Oh, it's not nice of you. I feel, I
can tell, you're thinking about Victor Kar&eacute;nin.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Why not? He loved her
for ten years, and she him, I believe.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Yes, but she doesn't love him as a
husband. They grew up together; they've just been friends.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Ah, those friendships!
How should you know what keeps them warm! If only they were both
free!</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Enter a</i> MAID <i>L. U.</i></p>

<p class="follow">Well?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Maid</i>. The porter's just come back with an
answer to the note.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. What note?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Maid</i>. The note Elizaveta Protosova sent to
Victor Kar&eacute;nin.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Well? What answer?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Maid</i>. Victor Kar&eacute;nin told the porter
he'd be here directly.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>To</i> SASHA.</p>

<p class="follow">Why do you suppose she sent for him? Do you
know?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Maybe I do and maybe I don't.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. You're always so full
of secrets.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Ask Lisa, she'll tell you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Just as I thought! She
sent for him at once.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Yes, but maybe not for the reason you
think.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Then what for?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Why, Mother, Lisa cares just about as
much for Victor Kar&eacute;nin as she does for her old nurse.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. You'll see. She wants
consolation, a special sort of consolation.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sasha</i>. Really, it shows you don't know Lisa
at all to talk like this.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. You'll see.
<i>Sasha</i>. Yes, I shall see.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i> (<i>alone to
herself</i>). And I am very glad. I'm very, very glad.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>goes C. and stands behind
table C</i>.). (<i>Shaking hands with Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>.)
Elizaveta Andreyevna sent me a note to come at once. I should have
been here to-night anyway. How is she? Well, I hope.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Not very. The baby has
been upset again. However, she'll be here in a minute. Will you
have some tea?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. No, thank you.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Sits chair R.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Tell me, do you know
that he and she&mdash;.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Yes, I was here two days ago
when she got this letter. Is she positive now about their
separating?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Oh, absolutely. It
would be impossible to begin it all over again.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Yes. To cut into living
things and then draw back the knife is terrible. But are you sure
she knows her mind?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. I should think so. To
come to this decision has caused her much pain. But now it's final,
and he understands perfectly that his behavior has made it
impossible for him to come back on any terms.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Why?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. After breaking every
oath he swore to decency, how could he come back? And so why
shouldn't he give her her freedom?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. What freedom is there for a
woman still married?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Divorce. He promised
her a divorce and we shall insist upon it.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. But your daughter was so in
love with him?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. Her love has been
tried out of existence. Remember she had everything to contend
with: drunkenness, gambling, infidelity&mdash;what was there to go on
loving in such a person?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Love can do anything.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna</i>. How can one love a rag
torn by every wind? Their affairs were in dreadful shape; their
estate mortgaged; no money anywhere. Finally his uncle sends them
two thousand rubles to pay the interest on the estate. He takes it,
disappears, leaves Lisa home and the baby sick&mdash;when suddenly she
gets a note asking her to send him his linen.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. And now you're sorry?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>nodding</i>). I feel I oughtn't to

again. Victor dear, I want you to give him this letter and tell him

Thank you for trusting me. I'll do all I can.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i>. I know you will. Now I'm going to tell
you everything. I went to-day to Afr&eacute;mov's, to find out
where he was. They told me he was living with the gypsies. Of
course that's what I was afraid of. I know he'll be swept off his
feet if he isn't stopped in time. So you'll go, won't you?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Where's the place?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i>. It's that big tenement where the gypsy
orchestra lives, on the left bank below the bridge. I went there
myself. I went as far as the door, and was just going to send up
the letter, but somehow I was afraid. I don't know why. And then I
thought of you. Tell him, tell him I've forgotten everything and
that I'm here waiting for him to come home. (<i>Crosses to</i>

<p class="hang">SOPHIA KAR&Eacute;NINA'S <i>boudoir</i>. SOPHIA
KAR&Eacute;NINA, VICTOR'S <i>mother, is reading a book. She is a
great lady, over fifty, but tries to look younger. She likes to

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i>. Ah, you know well
que vous &ecirc;tes toujours le bien venu.... Tell me, you have
received my letter?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. I did. Me voil&agrave;.
(<i>Sits L. on sofa L</i>.) <i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i>
(<i>working up to distress</i>). Oh, my dear friend, I begin to
lose hope. She's bewitched him, positively bewitched him. Il est
ensorcel&eacute;. I never knew he could be so obstinate, so
heartless, and so indifferent to me. He's changed completely since
that woman left her husband.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> How do matters actually
stand?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> Well, he's made up
his mind to marry her at any cost.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> And her husband?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> He agrees to a
divorce.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> Really?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> And Victor is
willing to put up with all the sordidness, the vulgarity of the
divorce court, the lawyers, evidences of guilt ... tout &ccedil;a
est d&eacute;go&ucirc;tant. I can't understand his sensitive nature
not being repelled by it.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i> (<i>smiling</i>). He's in
love, and when a man's really in love&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i>
(<i>interrupting</i>). In our time love could remain pure, coloring
one's whole life with a romantic friendship. Such love I understand
and value.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i> (<i>sighing</i>). However,
the present generation refuses to live on dreams. (<i>He coughs
delicately</i>.) La possession de l'&acirc;me ne leur suffit plus.
So what is the alternative? But tell me more of Victor.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> There's not very
much to say. He seems bewitched, hardly my son. Did you know I'd
called upon her? Victor pressed me so it was impossible to refuse.
But Dieu merci, I found her out. So I merely left my card, and now
she has asked me if I could receive her to-day, and I am expecting
her (<i>she glances at her watch</i>) any moment now. I am doing
all this to please Victor, but conceive my feelings. I know you
always can. Really, really, I need your help.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i> (<i>bowing</i>). Thank you
for the honor you do me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i>. You realize this
visit decides Victor's fate. I must refuse my consent, or&mdash;&mdash;But
that's impossible.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> Have you met her?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> I've never seen her,
but I'm afraid of her. No good woman leaves her husband, especially
when there's nothing obviously intolerable about him. Why,
I've seen Protosov often with Victor, and found him even
quite charming.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i> (<i>murmurs</i>). So I've
heard. So I've heard.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i> (<i>continuing</i>).
She should bear her cross without complaint. And Victor must cease
trying to persuade himself that his happiness lies in defying his
principles. What I don't understand is how Victor, with his
religious views, can think of marrying a divorced woman. I've heard
him say over and over again&mdash;once quite lately&mdash;that divorce is
totally inconsistent with true Christianity. If she's been able to
fascinate him to that point, I <i>am</i> afraid of her.&mdash;But how
stupid of me to talk all the time! Have you spoken to him at all?
What does he say? And don't you thoroughly agree with me?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. Yes, I've spoken to Victor.
I think he really loves her, has grown accustomed to the idea of
loving her, pour ainsi dire. (<i>Shaking his head</i>.) I don't
believe he could ever now care for another woman.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i> (<i>sighing</i>). And
Varia Casanzeva would have made him such a charming wife. She's so
devoted already.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I am afraid
I hardly see her in the present ... tableau. (<i>Earnestly</i>.)
Why not submit to Victor's wish and help him?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> To marry a
divorc&eacute;e? And afterwards have him running into his wife's
husband? How can you calmly suggest that a mother accept such a
situation for her son?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> But, ch&egrave;re amie, why
not approve of the inevitable? And you might console yourself by
regarding the dangers he'll avoid by marrying this gentle, lovely
woman. After all, suppose he conceived a passion for some
one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Convey the word "disreputable".</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> How can a good woman
leave her husband?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> Ah, that's not like you.
You're unkind and you're harsh. Her husband is the sort of
man&mdash;well, he's his own worst enemy. A weakling, a
ne'er-do-well&mdash;he's spent all his money and hers too. She has a
child. Do you think you can condemn her for leaving him? As a
matter of fact she didn't leave him, he left her.</p>

impossible. C'est plus fort que moi.</p>

There, there, my dear child, I assure you there's nothing in the
world to&mdash; (<i>He breaks off when he sees</i> SOPHIA
KAR&Eacute;NINA <i>pointing impatiently to the floor. She has
dropped her handkerchief</i>.) Permit me. (<i>He picks it up,
presenting it to her with a smile and a bow; then looks casually at
his watch</i>.) Ah, five o'clock already. (<i>To</i> SOPHIA
KAR&Eacute;NINA.) Madame, in your salon pleasure destroys the
memory of time. You will excuse me.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>He kisses her hand.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Au

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i> (<i>bowing and shaking hands
with</i> LISA). Elizaveta Protosova, au revoir.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>He goes out R.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> Now listen, my
child. Please believe how truly sorry for you I am and that you are
most sympathetique to me. But I love my son alone in this world,
and I know his soul as I do my own. He's very proud&mdash;oh I don't
mean of his position and money&mdash;but of his high ideals, his purity.
It may sound strange to you, but you must believe me when I tell
you that at heart he is as pure as a young girl.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> I know.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> He's never loved a
woman before. You're the first. I don't say I'm not a little
jealous. I am. But that's something we mothers have to face. Oh,
but your son's still a baby, you don't know. I was ready to give
him up, though&mdash;but I wanted his wife to be as pure as himself.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa (flushing hotly).</i> And I, am I
not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i> (<i>interrupting her
kindly</i>). Forgive me, my dear. I know it's not your fault and
that you've been most unhappy. And also I know my son. He will bear
anything, and he'll bear it without saying a word, but his hurt
pride will suffer and bring you infinite remorse. You must know how
strongly he has always felt that the bond of marriage is
indissoluble.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> Yes. I've thought of all that.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> Lisa, my dear,
you're a wise woman and you're a good woman too. If you love him,
you must want his happiness more than you want your own. You can't
want to cripple him so that he'll be sorry all his life&mdash;yes, sorry
even though he never says a word.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> I've thought about it so much. I've
thought about it and I've talked to him about it. But what can I do
when he says he can't live without me? I said to him only the other
day, "Victor, let's just be friends. Don't spoil your life. Don't
ruin yourself by trying to help me." And do you know what he did?
He laughed.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> Of course he would,
at the time.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> If you could persuade him not to marry
me, you know I'll agree, don't you? I just want him to be happy. I
don't care about myself. Only please help me. Please don't hate me.
Let's do all we can for him, because, after all, we both love
him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> Yes, I know. And I
think I love you too. I really do. (<i>She kisses her.</i> LISA
<i>begins to cry</i>.) Oh, it's all so dreadful. If only he had
fallen in love with you before you were married!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>sobbing</i>). He&mdash;he says he
did&mdash;but he had to be loyal to his friend.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina.</i> Alas, it's all very
heart-breaking. But let us love each other, and God will help us to
find what we are seeking.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>entering L. I</i>).
Mother darling. I've heard what you just said. I knew you'd love
her. And now everything must come right.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sophia Kar&eacute;nina</i> (<i>hastily</i>). But
nothing's decided. All I can say is, had things been different, I
should have been very glad. (<i>Tenderly</i>.) So very glad.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>She kisses</i> LISA.</p>

don't change. That's all I ask.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>At rise</i> MASHA <i>is heard outside

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> Ah, thank Heaven you've come.
I was wasting away in boredom.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha.</i> Then why didn't you come over to us?
(<i>Sees wine glass on chair near bed</i>.) So, you've been
drinking again? And after all your promises!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>embarrassed</i>). I didn't
come over because I had no money.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha.</i> Oh, why is it I love you so.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> Masha!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>imitating him</i>). Masha! Masha!
What's that mean? If you loved me, by now you'd have your divorce.
You say you don't love your wife. (<i>F&Eacute;DYA winces</i>.) But
you stick to her like grim death.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>interrupting her</i>). You
know why I don't want to.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha.</i> Nonsense. They're right when they say
you're no good. It's your mind that you can never make up
comfortably causing you all the worry.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> You know perfectly well that
the only joy I've got in life is being in love with you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha.</i> Oh, it's always "My joy," "Your
love." Where's your love and my joy?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>a little wearily</i>).
Well, Masha, after all, you've got all I can give, the best I've
ever had to give, perhaps, because you're so strong, so beautiful,
that sometimes you've made me know how to make you glad. So why
torture yourself?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>kneels and puts her arms around
his neck</i>). I won't if you're sure you love me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>coming closer to her</i>).
My beautiful young Masha.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>tearfully, searching his
face</i>). You do love me?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> Of course, of course.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha.</i> Only me, only me?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>kissing her</i>). Darling,
only you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>with a return to brightness</i>).
Now read me what you've written.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> It may bore you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>reproachfully</i>). How could
it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>reads</i>). "The snow was
flooded in moonlight and the birch trees wavered their stark
shadows across it like supplicating arms. Suddenly I heard the soft
padded sound of snow falling upon snow, to slowly perceive a
figure, the slender figure of a young child attempting to arouse
itself almost at my feet&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Enter</i> IV&Aacute;N <i>and</i>
NASTAS&Iuml;A. <i>They are two old gypsies,</i> MASHA'S
<i>parents.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nastas&iuml;a</i> (<i>stepping up to</i> MASHA).
So here you are&mdash;you cursed little stray sheep. No disrespect to
you, sir. (<i>To</i> MASHA.) You black-hearted, ungrateful little
snake. How dare you treat us like this, how dare you, eh?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Iv&aacute;n</i> (<i>to</i> F&Eacute;DYA). It's
not right, sir, what you've done, bringing to her ruin our only
child. It's against God's law.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nastas&iuml;a</i> (<i>to</i> MASHA). Come and
get out of here with me. You thought you'd skip, didn't you? And
what was I supposed to tell the troupe while you dangled around
here with this tramp? What can you get out of him, tell me that?
Did you know he hasn't got a kopek to his name, didn't you?</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>During scene with parents,</i> F&Eacute;DYA
<i>sits dumbly on the bed, bewildered. He puts his forehead
against</i> MASHA'S <i>face and clings to her like a child.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>sullenly</i>). I haven't done
anything wrong. I love this gentleman, that's all. I didn't leave
the troupe either. I'll go on singing just the same.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Iv&aacute;n</i>. If you talk any more, I'll pull
your hair all out for you, you loose little beast, you. (<i>To</i>
F&Eacute;DYA, reproachfully.) And you, sir, when we were so fond of
you&mdash;why, often and often we used to sing for you for nothing and
this is how you pay us back.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nastas&iuml;a</i> (<i>rocking herself to and
fro</i>). You've ruined our daughter, our very own, our only one,
our best beloved, our diamond, our precious one, (<i>with sudden
fury</i>). You've stamped her into the dirt, you have. Where's your
fear of God?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Nastas&iuml;a, Nastas&iuml;a,
you've made a mistake. Your daughter is like a sister to me. I
haven't harmed her at all. I love her, that's true. But how can I
help it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Iv&aacute;n</i>. Well, why didn't you love her
when you had some money? If you'd paid us ten thousand rubles, you
could have owned her, body and soul. That's what respectable
gentlemen do. But you&mdash;you throw away every kopek you've got and
then you steal her like you'd steal a sack of meal. You ought to be
ashamed, sir.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Masha</i> (<i>rising, puts her arm around his
neck</i>). He didn't steal me. I went to him myself, and if you
take me away now, I'll come right back. If you take me away a
thousand times, I'll come back to him. I love him and that's
enough. My love will break through anything&mdash;through anything.
Through anything in the whole damn world.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nastas&iuml;a</i> (<i>trying to soothe her</i>).
Now, Mashenka darling, don't get cross. You know you haven't
behaved well to your poor old parents. There, there, come along
with us now.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>With greedy fingers that pretend to

<p class="hang"><i>Prince.</i> Excuse me. I'm afraid I'm intruding
upon a rather painful scene.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>getting up</i>). With whom
have I the honor&mdash; (<i>recognizing the Prince</i>). Ah, Prince
Sergius, how do you do?</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>They shake hands.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince</i> (<i>in a distinguished manner</i>). I
repeat that I am afraid to be most inopportune. I would rather not
have heard, but since I have, it's my duty to say so. When I
arrived I knocked several times, but I presume you could not have
heard through such uproar.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> Do sit down. (<i>Prince sits
chair R.C.</i>) Thanks for telling me you heard. (<i>Sits on bed up
C</i>.) It gives me a chance to explain it all. Forgive me for
saying your opinion of me can't concern me, but I want to tell you
that the way her parents talked to that young girl, that gypsy
singer, was absolutely unjust. She's as pure as your own mother. My
relations with her are simply friendly ones. Possibly there is a
ray of poetry in them, but that could hardly degrade her. However,
what can I do for you?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. Well, to begin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Excuse
me, Prince, but my present social position hardly warrants a visit
from you.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Smiling.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. I know that, but I ask you
to believe that your changed position does not influence me in what
I am about to tell you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>interrogatively</i>).
Then?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. To be as brief as possible,
Victor Kar&eacute;nin, the son of my old friend, Sophia
Kar&eacute;nina, and she herself, have asked me to discover from
you personally what your present relations are with your wife, and
what intentions you have regarding them.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. My relations with my wife&mdash;I
should say my former wife&mdash;are several.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. As I thought, and for this
reason accepted my somewhat difficult mission.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>quickly</i>). I wish to say
first of all that the fault was entirely mine. She is, just as she
always was, absolutely stainless, faultless.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. Victor Kar&eacute;nin and
especially his mother are anxious to know your exact intentions
regarding the future.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. I've got no intentions. I've
given her full freedom. I know she loves Victor Kar&eacute;nin, let
her. Personally, I think he is a bore, but he is a good bore. So
they'll probably be very happy together, at least in the ordinary
sense and que le bon Dieu les b&eacute;nisse.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. Yes, but we&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>rising, goes L., leans on
table</i>). Please don't think I'm jealous. If I just said Victor
was dull, I take it back. He's splendid, very decent, in fact the
opposite of myself, and he's loved her since her childhood
(<i>slowly</i>) and maybe she loved him even when we were married.
After all, that happens, and the strongest love is perhaps
unconscious love. Yes, I think she's always loved him far, far down
beneath what she would admit to herself, and this feeling of nine
has been a black shadow across our married life. But&mdash; I&mdash;I really
don't suppose I ought to be talking to you like this, ought I?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. Please go on. My only object
in coming was to understand this situation completely, and I begin
to see how the shadow&mdash;as you charmingly express it&mdash;could have
been&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>looking strangely ahead of
him</i>). Yes, no brightness could suck up that shadow. And so I
suppose I never was satisfied with what my wife gave me, and I
looked for every kind of distraction, sick at heart because I did
so. I see it more and more clearly since we've been apart. Oh, but
I sound as if I were defending myself. God knows I don't want to do
that. No, I was a shocking bad husband. I say was, because now I
don't consider myself her husband at all. She's perfectly free.
There, does that satisfy you?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. Yes, but you know how
strictly orthodox Victor and his family are. Of course I don't
agree with them&mdash;perhaps I have broader views&mdash;(<i>with a
shrug</i>) but I understand how they feel. They consider that any
union without a church marriage is&mdash;well, to put it mildly,
unthinkable.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Yes, I know he's very stu&mdash;I
mean strict. (<i>With a slight smile</i>.) "Conservative" is the
word, isn't it? But what in God's name (<i>crossing to C</i>.) do
they want, a divorce? I told them long ago I was perfectly willing.
But the business of hiring a street-woman and taking her to a shady
hotel and arranging to be caught by competent witnesses&mdash;ugh&mdash;it's
all so&mdash;so loathsome.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>He shudders&mdash;pauses; and sits on bed.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius</i>. I know. I know. I assure
you, I can sympathize with such a repugnance, but how can one avoid
it? You see, it's the only way out. But, my dear boy, you mustn't
think I don't sympathize with you. It's a horrible situation for a
sensitive man and I quite understand how you must hate it.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Thank you, Prince Sergius. I
always knew you were kind and just. Now tell me what to do. Put
yourself in my place. I don't pretend to be any better than I
really am. I am a blackguard but there are some things that even I
can't do. (<i>With a smile and helpless gesture</i>.) I can't tell
lies.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> I must confess that you
bewilder me. You with your gifts and charm and really au fond&mdash;a
wonderful sense of what's right. How could you have permitted
yourself to plunge into such tawdry distractions? How could you
have forgotten so far what you owed to yourself? Tell me, why did
you let your life fall into this ruin?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>suppressing emotion</i>).
I've led this sort of life for ten years and you're the first real
person to show me sympathy. Of course, I've been pitied by the
degraded ones but never before by a sensible, kind man like you.
Thanks more than it's possible to say. (<i>He seems to forget his
train of thought and suddenly to recall it</i>.) Ah, yes, my ruin.
Well, first, drink, not because it tasted well, but because
everything I did disappointed me so, made me so ashamed of myself.
I feel ashamed now, while I talk to you. Whenever I drank, shame
was drowned in the first glass, and sadness. Then music, not opera
or Beethoven, but gypsy music; the passion of it poured energy into
my body, while those dark bewitching eyes looked into the bottom of
my soul. (<i>He sighs</i>.) And the more alluring it all was, the
more shame I felt afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Pause.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> But what about your
career?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya.</i> My career? This seems to be
it. Once I was a director of a bank. There was something terribly
lacking between what I felt and what I could do. (<i>Abruptly</i>.)
But enough, enough of myself. It makes me rather nervous to think
about myself.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Prince Sergius.</i> What answer am I to take

them I'm quite at their disposal. (<i>Walking up and down</i>) They
want to marry, and there mustn't be anything in their way

should I stop you? Life and death are the same to genius. I'm dead
during life and I live after death. You kill yourself in order to
make a few people miss you, but I&mdash;but I&mdash;am going to kill myself

told them you'd kill yourself, is that it? But you didn't say
anything about a revolver. Oh, F&eacute;dya, let me think, there

day we all went to the picnic to the White Lakes with Mama and
Afr&eacute;mov and the young Cossack officer? And you buried the
bottles of wine in the sand to keep them cool while we went in
bathing? Do you remember how you took my hands and drew me out
beyond the waves till the water was quite silent and flashing
almost up to our throats, and then suddenly it seemed as if there
were nothing under our feet? We tried to get back. We couldn't and
you shouted out, "Afr&eacute;mov," and if he hadn't been almost
beside us and pulled us in&mdash;and how cross he was with you for
forgetting that you couldn't swim, and after, how wonderful it was
to stretch out safely on the sands in the sunlight. Oh, how nice
every one was to us that day and you kept on being so sorry for
forgetting you couldn't swim! And, F&eacute;dya, don't you see? Of
course, she must know you can't swim. Oh, it's all getting as clear
as daylight. You will send her this beautiful letter. Your clothes
will be found on the river bank&mdash;but instead of being in the river
you will be far away with me&mdash;F&eacute;dya, don't you see, don't
you see? You will be dead to her, but alive for me.

<h4>SCENE VI</h4>

<p class="hang"><i>The</i> PROTOSOVS' <i>drawing-room</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">KAR&Eacute;NIN <i>and</i> LISA.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>sitting chair R</i>.). He's promised me
definitely, and I'm sure he'll keep to it.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>sitting chair R. C</i>.). I'm
rather ashamed to confess it, Victor, but since I found out about
this&mdash;this gypsy, I feel completely free of him. Of course, I am
not in the least jealous, but knowing this makes me see that I owe
him nothing more. Am I clear to you, I wonder?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>coming closer to
her</i>). Yes, dear, I think I'll always understand you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Don't interrupt me,
but let me speak as I think. The thing that tortured me most was I
seemed to love both of you at once, and that made me seem so
indecent to myself.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>incredulously
amused</i>). You indecent?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>continuing</i>). But since I've
found out that there's another woman, that he doesn't need me any
more, I feel free, quite free of him. And now I can say truthfully,
I love you. Because everything is clear in my soul. My only worry
is the divorce, and all the waiting to be gone through before we
can&mdash;&mdash; Ah, that's torturing.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Dearest, everything will be
settled soon. After all, he's promised, and I've asked my secretary
to go to him with the petition and not to leave until he's signed
it. Really, sometimes, if I didn't know him as I do, I'd think he
was trying on purpose to discomfort us.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i>. No. No. It's, only the same weakness
and honesty fighting together in him. He doesn't want to lie.
However, I'm sorry you sent him money.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. If I hadn't, it might have
delayed things. <i>Lisa</i>. I know, but money seems so ugly.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>slightly ruffled</i>). I
hardly think it's necessary to be so delicate with
F&eacute;dya.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i>. Perhaps, perhaps. (<i>Smiling</i>.)
But don't you think we are becoming very selfish?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i>. Maybe. But it's all your
fault, dear. After all, this hopelessness and waiting, to think of
being happy at last! I suppose happiness does make us selfish.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> Don't believe you're alone in your
happiness or selfishness. I am so filled with joy it makes me
almost afraid. Misha's all right, your mother loves me, and above
all, you are here, close to me, loving me as I love you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>bending over her and
searching her eyes</i>). You're sure you've no regret?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> From the day I found out about that
gypsy woman, my mind underwent a change that has set me free.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin.</i> You're sure?</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Kissing her hands.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>passionately</i>). Darling, I've
only one desire now, and that is to have you forget the past and
love as I do.</p>

instincts and desires make up our beings!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa.</i> Why?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin</i> (<i>slowly</i>). I don't
know. When I came back from abroad, knew I'd lost you, I was
unhappy, terribly. Yet, it was enough for me to learn that you at
least remembered me. Afterward, when we became friends, and you
were kind to me, and into our friendship wavered a spark of
something more than friendship, ah, I was almost happy! Only one
thing tormented me: fear that such a feeling wronged F&eacute;dya.
Afterwards, when F&eacute;dya tortured you so, I saw I could help.
Then a certain definite hope sprang up in me. And later, when he
became impossible and you decided to leave him, and I showed you my
heart for the first time, and you didn't say no, but went away in
tears--then I was happy through and through. Then came the
possibility of joining our lives. Mamma loved you. You told me you
loved me, that F&eacute;dya was gone out of your heart, out of your
life forever, and there was only, only me.... Ah, Lisa, for what
more could I ask! Yet the past tortured me. Awful fancies would
flush up into my happiness, turning it all into hatred for your
past.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i> (<i>interrupting reproachfully</i>).
Victor!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Kar&eacute;nin.</i> Forgive me, Lisa. I only
tell you this because I don't want to hide a single thought from
you. I want you to know how bad I am, and what a weakness I've got
to fight down. But don't worry, I'll get past it. It's all right,
dear. (<i>He bends over, kissing the child on the head</i>.) And I
love him, too.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Lisa</i>. Dearest, I'm so happy. Everything has
happened in my heart to make it as you'd wish.</p>

<h3>ACT II</h3>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="hang"><i>A dirty, ill-lighted underground dive; people
are lying around drinking, sleeping, playing cards and making love.
Near the front a small table at which</i> F&Eacute;DYA <i>sits; he
is in rags and has fallen very low. By his side is</i>
PETUSHK&Oacute;V, a delicate spiritual man, with long yellow hair
and beard. Both are rather drunk.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Candle light is the only lighting in this
Scene.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i> (<i>R.C. of table C</i>.).
I know. I know. Well, that's real love. So what happened then?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>L. C. of table C.,
pensively</i>). You might perhaps expect a girl of our own class,
tenderly brought up, to be capable of sacrificing for the man she
loved, but this girl was a gypsy, reared in greed, yet she gave me
the purest sort of self-sacrificing love. She'd have done anything
for nothing. Such contrasts are amazing.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. I see. In painting we call
that value. Only to realize bright red fully when there is green
around it. But that's not the point. What happened?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Oh, we parted. I felt it
wasn't right to go on taking, taking where I couldn't give. So one
night we were having dinner in a little restaurant, I told her we'd
have to say good-bye. My heart was so wrung all the time I could
hardly help crying.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. And she?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Oh, she was awfully unhappy, but she knew I
was right. So we kissed each other a long while, and she went back
to her gypsy troupe&mdash;(<i>Slowly</i>.) Maybe she was glad to
go&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. I wonder.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Yes. The single good act of my
soul was not ruining that girl.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. Was it from pity?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. <i>I</i> sorry for <i>her?</i>
Oh, never. Quite the contrary. I worshipped her unclouded
sincerity, the energy of her clear, strong will, and God in Heaven,
how she sang. And probably she is singing now, for some one else.
Yes, I always looked up at her from beneath, as you do at some
radiance in the sky. I loved her really. And now it's a tender
beautiful memory.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. I understand. It was
ideal, and you left it like that.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>ruminatingly</i>). And I've
been attracted often, you know. Once I was in love with a grande
dame, bestially in love, dog-like. Well, she gave me a rendezvous,
and I didn't, couldn't, keep it, because suddenly I thought of her
husband, and it made me feel sick. And you know, it's queer, that
now, when I look back, instead of being glad that I was decent, I
am as sorry as if I had sinned. But with Masha it's so different;
I'm filled with joy that I've never soiled the brightness of my
feeling for her. (<i>He points his finger at the floor</i>.) I may
go much further down.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). I
know so well what you mean. But where is she now?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. I don't know. I don't want to
know. All that belongs to another life, and I couldn't bear to mix
that life and this life.</p>

<p class="indent">[A POLICE OFFICER <i>enters from up R., kicks a
man who is lying on the floor&mdash;walks down stage, looks at</i>
F&Eacute;DYA <i>and</i> PETUSHK&Oacute;V, then exits.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. Your life's wonderful. I
believe you're a real idealist.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. No. It's awfully simple. You
know among our class&mdash;I mean the class I was born in&mdash;there are
only three courses: the first, to go into the civil service or join
the army and make money to squander over your sensual appetites.
And all that was appalling to me&mdash;perhaps because I couldn't do it.
The second thing is to live to clear out, to destroy what is foul,
to make way for the beautiful. But for that you've got to be a
hero, and I'm not a hero. And the third is to forget it
all&mdash;overwhelm it with music, drown it with wine. That's what
<i>I</i> did. And look (<i>he spreads his arms out</i>) where my
singing led me to.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>He drinks.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. And what about family
life? The sanctity of the home and all that&mdash;I would have been
awfully happy if I'd had a decent wife. As it was, she ruined
me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. I beg your pardon. Did you say
marriage? Oh, yes, of course. Well, I've been married, too. Oh, my
wife was quite an ideal woman. I don't know why I should say was,
by the way, because she's still living. But there's something&mdash;I
don't know; it's rather difficult to explain&mdash;But you know how
pouring champagne into a glass makes it froth up into a million
iridescent little bubbles? Well, there was none of that in our
married life. There was no fizz in it, no sparkle, no taste, phew!
The days were all one color&mdash;flat and stale and gray as the devil.
And that's why I wanted to get away and forget. You can't forget
unless you play. So trying to play I crawled in every sort of muck
there is. And you know, it's a funny thing, but we love people for
the good we do them, and we hate them for the harm. That's why I
hated Lisa. That's why she seemed to love me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. Why do you say seemed?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>wistfully</i>). Oh, she
couldn't creep into the center of my being like Masha. But that's
not what I mean. Before the baby was born, and afterwards, when she
was nursing him, I used to stay away for days and days, and come
back drunk, drunk, and love her less and less each time, because I
was wronging her so terribly. (<i>Excitedly</i>.) Yes. That's it, I
never realized it before. The reason why I loved Masha was because
I did her good, not harm. But I crucified my wife, and her
contortions filled me almost with hatred.</p>

It's a rather curious story. My wife's married.</p>

<p class="follow">Funny, I seem to be able to say anything to you.
And it's so long ago, so long ago. And what is it after all to you
but a story? Well, when I got to the climax of torturing my wife,
when I'd squandered everything I had or could get, and become
utterly rotten, then, there appeared a protector.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. The usual thing, I
suppose?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i>. Don't think anything filthy
about it. He was just her friend, mine too, a very good, decent
fellow; in fact the opposite of myself. He'd known my wife since
she was a child, and I suppose he'd loved her since then. He used
to come to our house a lot. First I was very glad he did, then I
began to see they were falling in love with each other, and
then&mdash;an odd thing began to happen to me at night. Do you know when
she lay there asleep beside me (<i>he laughs shrilly</i>) I would
hear him, pushing open the door, crawling into the room, coming to
me on his hands and knees, grovelling, whining, begging me (<i>he
is almost shouting</i>) for her, for her, imagine it! And I, I had
to get up and give my place to him. (<i>He covers his eyes with his
hands in a. convulsive moment</i>.) Phew! Then I'd come to
myself.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. God! It must have been
horrible.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>wearily</i>). Well, later
on I left her&mdash;and after a while, they asked me for a divorce. I
couldn't bear all the lying there was to be got through. Believe me
it was easier to think of killing myself. And so I tried to commit
suicide, and I tried and I couldn't. Then a kind friend came along
and said, "Now, don't be foolish!" And she arranged the whole
business for me. I sent my wife a farewell letter&mdash;and the next day
my clothes and pocketbook were found on the bank of the river.
Everybody knew I couldn't swim. (<i>Pause</i>.) You understand,
don't you?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petushk&oacute;v</i>. Yes, but what about the
body? They didn't find that?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>F&eacute;dya</i> (<i>smiling drunkenly</i>). Oh
yes, they did! You just listen! About a week afterwards some horror
was dragged out of the water. My wife was called in to identify it.
It was in pretty bad shape, you know. She took one glance. "Is that
your husband?" they asked her. And she said, "Yes." Well, that
settled it! I was buried, they were married, and they're living
very happily right here in this city. I'm living here, too! We're
all living here together! Yesterday I walked right by their house.
The windows were lit and somebody's shadow went across the blind.

done, and cleared away my weak life from interfering with their
strong good lives. And yet we're all alive. When suddenly a bastard
adventurer appears, who demands that I abet his filthy scheme. I
drive him off as I would a diseased dog, but he finds you, the
defender of public justice, the appointed guardian of morality, to
listen to him. And you, who receive on the 20th of each month a few
kopeks' gratuity for your wretched business, you get into your
uniform, and in good spirits proceed to torture&mdash;bully people whose
threshold you're not clean enough to pass. Then when you've had
your fill of showing off your wretched power, oh, then you are
satisfied, and sit and smile there in your damned complacent
dignity. And....</p>

premeditation. Do you want to go in?</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The Act takes place in autumn in a large

sitting on a wooden bench, mending a horse-collar.</i>
AN&Iacute;SYA <i>and</i> AKOUL&Iacute;NA <i>are spinning, and
singing a part-song.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i> (<i>looking out of the window</i>).
The horses have got loose again. If we don't look out they'll be
killing the colt. Nik&iacute;ta! Hey, Nik&iacute;ta! Is the fellow
deaf? (<i>Listens. To the women</i>.) Shut up, one can't hear
anything.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i> (<i>from outside</i>).
What?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. Drive the horses in.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. We'll drive 'em in. All in
good time.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i> (<i>shaking his head</i>). Ah, these
laborers! If I were well, I'd not keep one on no account. There's
nothing but bother with 'em. (<i>Rises and sits down again</i>.)
Nik&iacute;ta!.... It's no good shouting. One of you'd better go.
Go, Ako&uacute;l, drive 'em in.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Akoul&iacute;na</i>. What? The horses?</p>

yourself. When you're not sprawling on the top of the oven you're

for.</p>

one'd have no roof left over one's head before the year's out. Oh,
what people!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. You go shoving a dozen jobs
on to one's shoulders, and then do nothing but scold. It's easy to
lie on the oven and give orders.</p>

for this sickness that's got hold of me, I'd not keep him on
another day.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i> (<i>mimicking him</i>). "Like

<p class="hang"><i>Akoul&iacute;na</i>. Where's Nik&iacute;ta? Why,
standing out there in the street.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. What's he standing there for?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Akoul&iacute;na</i>. What's he standing there
for? He stands there jabbering.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. One can't get any sense out of her!

at my wedding. I'm leaving you," he says, and laughs.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i> (<i>to her husband</i>). There
now. Much he cares. You see, he wants to leave of himself. "Sack
him" indeed!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. Well, let him go. Just as if I
couldn't find somebody else.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. And what about the money he's
had in advance?</p>

<p class="indent">[NAN <i>stands listening at the door for awhile,

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i> (<i>frowning</i>). The money? Well, he
can work it off in summer, anyhow.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Well, of course you'll be
glad if he goes and you've not got to feed him. It's only me as'll
have to work like a horse all the winter. That lass of yours isn't
over fond of work either. And you'll be lying up on the oven. I
know you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. What's the good of wearing out one's
tongue before one has the hang of the matter?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. The yard's full of cattle.
You've not sold the cow, and have kept all the sheep for the
winter: feeding and watering 'em alone takes all one's time, and
you want to sack the laborer. But I tell you straight, I'm not
going to do a man's work! I'll go and lie on the top of the oven
same as you, and let everything go to pot! You may do what you
like.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i> (<i>to Akoul&iacute;na</i>). Go and

Here's a go; I'm in a regular fix! That governor of mine wants to

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> That'll do, An&iacute;sya. Do
you think I'll forget you? Never while I live! I'll not play you
false, that's flat. I've been thinking that supposing they do go
and make me marry, I'd still come back to you. If only he don't
make me live at home.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> Much need I'll have of you,

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> Yes, I daresay, shove it all
on your father. You know it's your own doing. You've long been
plotting with that slut of yours, Mar&iacute;na. It's she has put
you up to it. She didn't come here for nothing t'other day.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> Mar&iacute;na? What's she to
me? Much I care about her!... Plenty of them buzzing around.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> Then what has made your

deceived me.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Cries.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> An&iacute;sya, do you believe

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> There was a fellow wouldn't

it might come to! I've no great wish for that sort of thing. They
say it touches one up....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> Shut up with your nonsense.
Nik&iacute;ta, listen to me: if you marry that Mar&iacute;na I
don't know what I won't do to myself.... I shall lay hands on
myself! I have sinned, I have gone against the law, but I can't go
back now. If you go away I'll....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> Why should I go? Had I wanted
to go&mdash;I should have gone long ago. There was Iv&aacute;n

not go. Because, I reckon, I am good enough for any one. Now if you
did not love me it would be a different matter.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> Yes, and that's what you

lawful, and then you'll be master here.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> Where's the good of making

But your master is out in the yard a-calling you, sonny.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> I only came to get the

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i> (<i>stooping to pick up

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Eh, honey! why should you
marry? Go on as you are. It's all the old man. You'd better go,
sonny; we can talk these matters over without you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta.</i> It's a queer go! One moment
I'm to be married, the next, not. I can't make head or tail of
it.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> What's it all about, then? Do
you really wish him to get married?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Eh, why should he marry, my

But he's reckoning without his host. You know the saying, "From
oats and hay, why should horses stray?" When you've enough to
spare, why look elsewhere? And so in this case. (<i>Winks</i>.)
Don't I see which way the wind blows?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Dear me, here's news! D'you
think Mother Matry&oacute;na didn't know? Eh, lassie,&mdash;Mother
Matry&oacute;na's been ground, and ground again, ground fine! This
much I can tell you, my jewel: Mother Matry&oacute;na can see
through a brick wall three feet thick. I know it all, my jewel! I
know what young wives need sleeping draughts for, so I've brought
some along.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Unties a knot in her handkerchief and brings
out paper-packets.</i></p>

<p class="follow">As much as is wanted, I see, and what's not
wanted I neither see nor perceive! There! Mother Matry&oacute;na
has also been young. I had to know a thing or two to live with my
old fool. I know seventy-and-seven dodges. But I see your old man's
quite seedy, quite seedy! How's one to live with such as him? Why,
if you pricked him with a hayfork it wouldn't fetch blood. See if
you don't bury him before the spring. Then you'll need some one in
the house. Well, what's wrong with my son? He'll do as well as
another. Then where's the advantage of my taking him away from a
good place? Am I my child's enemy?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Oh, if only he does not go
away!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. He won't go away, birdie.
It's all nonsense. You know my old man. His wits are always
wool-gathering; yet sometimes he takes a thing into his pate, and
it's as if it were wedged in, you can't knock it out with a
hammer.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. And what started this
business?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Well, you see, my jewel,
you yourself know what a fellow with women the lad is,&mdash;and he's
handsome too, though I say it as shouldn't. Well, you know, he was
living at the railway, and they had an orphan wench there to cook
for them. Well, that same wench took to running after him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Mar&iacute;na?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Yes, the plague seize her!
Whether anything happened or not, anyhow something got to my old
man's ears. Maybe he heard from the neighbors, maybe she's been and
blabbed....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Well, she is a bold
hussy!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. So my old man&mdash;the old
blockhead&mdash;off he goes: "Marry, marry," he says, "he must marry her
and cover the sin," he says. "We must take the lad home," he says,
"and he shall marry," he says. Well, I did my best to make him
change his mind, but, dear me, no. So, all right, thinks I,&mdash;I'll
try another dodge. One always has to entice them fools in this way,
just pretend to be of their mind, and when it comes to the point
one goes and turns it all one's own way. You know, a woman has time
to think seventy-and-seven thoughts while falling off the oven, so
how's such as he to see through it? "Well, yes," says I, "it would
be a good job,&mdash;only we must consider well beforehand. Why not go
and see our son, and talk it over with Peter Ign&aacute;titch and
hear what he has to say?" So here we are.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Oh dear, oh dear, how will it
all end? Supposing his father just orders him to marry her?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Orders, indeed! Chuck his
orders to the dogs! Don't you worry; that affair will never come
off. I'll go to your old man myself, and sift and strain this
matter clear&mdash;there will be none of it left. I have come here only
for the look of the thing. A very likely thing! Here's my son
living in happiness and expecting happiness, and I'll go and match
him with a slut! No fear, I'm not a fool!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. And she&mdash;this
Mar&iacute;na&mdash;came dangling after him here! Mother, would you
believe, when they said he was going to marry, it was as if a knife
had gone right through my heart. I thought he cared for her.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Oh, my jewel! Why, you
don't think him such a fool, that he should go and care for a
homeless baggage like that? Nik&iacute;ta is a sensible fellow, you
see. He knows whom to love. So don't you go and fret, my jewel.
We'll not take him away, and we won't marry him. No, we'll let him
stay on, if you'll only oblige us with a little money.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. All I know is, that I could
not live if Nik&iacute;ta went away.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Naturally, when one's young
it's no easy matter! You, a wench in full bloom, to be living with
the dregs of a man like that husband of yours.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Mother Matry&oacute;na, would
you believe it? I'm that sick of him, that sick of this long-nosed
cur of mine, I can hardly bear to look at him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Yes, I see, it's one of
them cases. Just look here. (<i>Looks round and whispers</i>.) I've
been to see that old man, you know he's given me simples of two
kinds. This, you see, is a sleeping draught. "Just give him one of
these powders," he says, "and he'll sleep so sound you might jump
on him!" And this here, "This is that kind of simple," he says,
"that if you give one some of it to drink it has no smell whatever,
but its strength is very great. There are seven doses here, a pinch
at a time. Give him seven pinches," he says, "and she won't have
far to look for freedom," he says.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. O-o-oh! What's that?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. "No sign whatever," he
says. He's taken a rouble for it. "Can't sell it for less," he
says. Because it's no easy matter to get 'em, you know. I paid him,
dearie, out of my own money. If she takes them, thinks I, it's all
right; if she don't, I can let old Michael's daughter have
them.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> O-o-oh! But mayn't some evil
come of them? I'm frightened!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. What evil, my jewel? If
your old man was hale and hearty, 'twould be a different matter,
but he's neither alive nor dead as it is. He's not for this world.
Such things often happen.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> O-o-oh, my poor head! I'm
afeared, Mother Matry&oacute;na, lest some evil come of them. No.
That won't do.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Just as you like. I might
even return them to him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> And are they to be used in
the same way as the others? Mixed in water?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Better in tea, he says. "You
can't notice anything," he says, "no smell nor nothing." He's a
cute old fellow, too.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i> (<i>taking the powder</i>).
O-oh, my poor head! Could I have ever thought of such a thing if my
life were not a very hell?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> You'll not forget that
rouble? I promised to take it to the old man. He's had some
trouble, too.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> Of course?</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Goes to her box and hides the

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> As to marrying, he might
bide a while, Peter Ign&aacute;titch. You know our poverty, Peter
Ign&aacute;titch. What's he to marry on? We've hardly enough to eat

<p class="hang"><i>Peter.</i> You must consider what will be

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Where's the hurry for him

ripe raspberries that drop off if not picked in time.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter.</i> If he were to get married, 'twould be
a good thing in a way.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m.</i> We'd like to ... what d'you

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> And a fine job

worse than malt grain, and then it's, what d'you call it, ... pays,
pays, I mean. And as to the smell being, what d'you call it, it's
not for the likes of us to complain. And one changes one's clothes.
So we'd like to take what's his name ... Nik&iacute;ta, I mean,
home. Let him manage things at home while I, what d'you call
it,&mdash;earn something in town.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter.</i> You want to keep your son at home?
Yes, that would be well: but how about the money he has had in
advance?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m.</i> That's it, that's it! It's just
as you Say, Ign&aacute;titch, it's just what d'you call it. 'Cos
why? If you go into service, it's as good as if you had sold
yourself, they say. That will be all right. I mean he may stay and
serve his time, only he must, what d'you call it, get married. I
mean&mdash;so: you let him off for a little while, that he may, what
d'you call it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter.</i> Yes, we could manage that.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Ah, but it's not yet
settled between ourselves, Peter Ign&aacute;titch. I'll speak to
you as I would before God, and you may judge between my old man and
me. He goes on harping on that marriage. But just ask&mdash;who it is he
wants him to marry. If it were a girl of the right sort now&mdash;I am
not my child's enemy, but the wench is not honest.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. No, that's wrong! Wrong, I say.
'Cos why? She, that same girl&mdash;it's my son as has offended,
offended the girl I mean.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. How offended?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. That's how. She's what d'you
call it, with him, with my son, Nik&iacute;ta. With Nik&iacute;ta,
what d'you call it, mean.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. You wait a bit, my tongue
runs smoother&mdash;let me tell it. You know, this lad of ours lived at
the railway before he came to you. There was a girl there as kept
dangling after him. A girl of no account, you know; her name's
Mar&iacute;na. She used to cook for the men. So now this same girl
accuses our son, Nik&iacute;ta, that he, so to say, deceived
her.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. Well, there's nothing good in
that.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. But she's no honest girl
herself; she runs after the fellows like a common slut.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. There you are again, old woman,
and it's not at all what d'you call it, it's all not what d'you
call it, I mean....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. There now, that's all the
sense one gets from my old owl&mdash;"what d'you call it, what d'you call
it," and he doesn't know himself what he means. Peter
Ign&aacute;titch, don't listen to me, but go yourself and ask any
one you like about the girl, everybody will say the same. She's
just a homeless good-for-nothing.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. You know, Daddy Ak&iacute;m, if
that's how things are, there's no reason for him to marry her. A
daughter-in-law's not like a shoe, you can't kick her off.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). It's false,
old woman, it's what d'you call it, false; I mean, about the girl;
false! 'Cos why? The lass is a good lass, a very good lass, you
know. I'm sorry, sorry for the lassie, I mean.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. It's an old saying: "For
the wide world old Miriam grieves, and at home without bread her
children she leaves." He's sorry for the girl, but not sorry for
his own son! Sling her round your neck and carry her about with
you! That's enough of such empty cackle!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. No, it's not empty.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. There, don't interrupt, let
me have my say.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i> (<i>interrupts</i>). No, not
empty! I mean, you twist things your own way, about the lass or
about yourself. Twist them, I mean, to make it better for yourself;
but God, what d'you call it, turns them His way. That's how it
is.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Eh! One only wears out
one's tongue with you.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. The lass is hard-working and
spruce, and keeps everything round herself ... what d'you call it.
And in our poverty, you know, it's a pair of hands, I mean; and the
wedding needn't cost much. But the chief thing's the offence, the
offence to the lass, and she's a what d'you call it, an orphan, you
know; that's what she is, and there's the offence.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Eh! they'll all tell you a
tale of that sort....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Daddy Ak&iacute;m, you'd
better listen to us women; we can tell you a thing or two.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. And God, how about God? Isn't
she a human being, the lass? A what d'you call it,&mdash;also a human
being I mean, before God. And how do you look at it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Eh! ... started off
again?...</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. Wait a bit, Daddy Ak&iacute;m. One
can't believe all these girls say, either. The lad's alive, and not
far away; send for him, and find out straight from him if it's
true. He won't wish to lose his soul. Go and call the fellow,
(<i>An&iacute;sya rises</i>) and tell him his father wants him.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Exit</i> AN&Iacute;SYA.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. That's right, dear friend;
you've cleared the way clean, as with water. Yes, let the lad speak
for himself. Nowadays, you know, they'll not let you force a son to
marry; one must first of all ask the lad. He'll never consent to
marry her and disgrace himself, not for all the world. To my
thinking, it's best he should go on living with you and serving you
as his master. And we need not take him home for the summer either;
we can hire a help. If you would only give us ten roubles now,
we'll let him stay on. <i>Peter</i>. All in good time. First let us
settle one thing before we start another. <i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. You
see, Peter Ign&aacute;titch, I speak. 'Cos why? you know how it
happens. We try to fix things up as seems best for ourselves, you
know; and as to God, we what d'you call it, we forget Him. We think
it's best so, turn it our own way, and lo! we've got into a fix,
you know. We think it will be best, I mean; and lo! it turns out
much worse&mdash;without God, I mean.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Peter</i>. Of course one must not forget
God.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. It turns out worse! But when
it's the right way&mdash;God's way&mdash;it what d'you call it, it gives one
joy; seems pleasant, I mean. So I reckon, you see, get him, the
lad, I mean, get him to marry her, to keep him from sin, I mean,
and let him what d'you call it at home, as it's lawful, I mean,
while I go and get the job in town. The work is of the right
sort&mdash;it's payin', I mean. And in God's sight it's what d'you call
it&mdash;it's best, I mean. Ain't she an orphan? Here, for example, a
year ago some fellows went and took timber from the
steward,&mdash;thought they'd do the steward, you know. Yes, they did
the steward, but they couldn't what d'you call it&mdash;do God, I mean.
Well, and so....</p>

you are thinking of taking him back in summer, I don't want him
here for the winter. If he is to stay at all, it must be for the
whole year.</p>

bind himself. If we want help when the press of work comes, we can
hire help, and the lad shall remain with you. Only give us ten
roubles now....</p>

Lord help you! Why are you turning it on to me? Mind, lass, don't
go twisting matters from the sick on to the healthy. If anything
were to happen, I stand aside! I know nothing! I'm aware of
nothing! I'll kiss the cross on it; I never gave you any kind of
powders, never saw any, never heard of any, and never knew there
were such powders. You think about yourself, lass. Why, we were
talking about you the other day. "Poor thing, what torture she
endures. The step-daughter an idiot; the old man rotten, sucking
her lifeblood. What wouldn't one be ready to do in such a
case!"</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. I'm not going to deny it. A
life such as mine could make one do worse than that. It could make
you hang yourself or throttle him. Is this a life?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. That's just it. There's no
time to stand gaping; the money must be found one way or other, and
then he must have his tea.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. O-oh, my head, my head! I
can't think what to do. I am so frightened; he'd better die of
himself. I don't want to have it on my soul.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i> (<i>viciously</i>). And why
doesn't he show the money? Does he mean to take it along with him?
Is no one to have it? Is that right? God forbid such a sum should
be lost all for nothing. Isn't that a sin? What's he doing? Is he
worth considering?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. I don't know anything. He's
worried me to death.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. What is it you don't know?
The business is clear. If you make a slip now, you'll repent it all
your life. He'll give the money to his sister and you'll be left
without.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. O&mdash;oh dear! Yes, and he did
send for her&mdash;I must go.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. You wait a bit and light

him too. I went there the other day. I had something else to
settle, you know. Well, so I sat and chatted awhile and then came
to the point. "Tell me, Iv&aacute;n Mos&eacute;vitch," says I,
"how's one to manage an affair of this kind? Supposing," says I, "a
peasant as is a widower married a second wife, and supposing all
the children he has is a daughter by the first wife, and a daughter
by the second. Then," says I, "when that peasant dies, could an
outsider get hold of the homestead by marrying the widow? Could
he," says I, "give both the daughters in marriage and remain master
of the house himself?" "Yes, he could," says he, "but," says he,
"it would mean a deal of trouble; still the thing could be managed
by means of money, but if there's no money it's no good
trying."</p>

foremost, your son will have to get himself on the register of that
village&mdash;that will cost something. The elders will have to be
treated. And they, you see, they'll sign. Everything," says he,
"must be done sensibly." Look (<i>unwraps her kerchief and takes

money, is she capable of arranging it all? One knows what a woman
is! You're a man anyhow. You can hide it, and all that. You see,

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. And the Lizoun&oacute;fs from

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. They made some steps too, but

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Time and more than time! Ah,

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Eh, eh, eh, what doings! Only
think of it. Why, he's her step-father!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Ah, friend, they've taken me
in completely. They've done me so fine it's beyond saying. I, fool
that I was, noticed nothing, suspected nothing, and so I married
him. I guessed nothing, but they already understood one
another.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Oh dear, what goings on!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. So it went on from bad to
worse, and I see they begin hiding from me. Ah, friend, I was that
sick&mdash;that sick of my life! It's not as if I didn't love him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. That goes without saying.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Ah, how hard it is to bear
such treatment from him! Oh, how it hurts!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Yes, and I've heard say he's
becoming too free with his fists?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. And that too! There was a
time when he was gentle when he'd had a drop. He used to hit out
before, but of me he was always fond! But now when he's in a temper
he goes for me and is ready to trample me under his feet. The other
day he got both my hands entangled in my hair so that I could
hardly get away. And the girl's worse than a serpent; it's a wonder
the earth bears such furies.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Ah, ah, my dear, now I look at
you, you are a sufferer! To suffer like that is no joke. To have
given shelter to a beggar, and he to lead you such a dance! Why
don't you pull in the reins?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Ah, but, my dear, if it
weren't for my heart! Him as is gone was stern enough, still I
could twist him about any way I liked; but with this one I can do
nothing. As soon as I see him all my anger goes. I haven't a grain
of courage before him; I go about like a drowned hen.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Ah, neighbor, you must be under a
spell. I've heard that Matry&oacute;na goes in for that sort of
thing. It must be her.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Yes, dear; I think so myself
sometimes. Gracious me, how hurt I feel at times! I'd like to tear
him to pieces. But when I set eyes on him, my heart won't go
against him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. It's plain you're bewitched. It
don't take long to blight a body. There now, when I look at you,
what you have dwindled to!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Growing a regular
spindle-shanks. And just look at that fool Akoul&iacute;na. Wasn't
the girl a regular untidy slattern, and just look at her now! Where
has it all come from? Yes, he has fitted her out. She's grown so
smart, so puffed up, just like a bubble that's ready to burst. And,
though she's a fool, she's got it into her head. "I'm the
mistress," she says; "the house is mine; it's me father wanted him
to marry." And she's that vicious! Lord help us, when she gets into
a rage she's ready to tear the thatch off the house.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Oh dear, what a life yours is, now
I come to look at you. And yet there's people envying you: "They're
rich," they say; but it seems that gold don't keep tears from
falling.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Much reason for envy indeed!
And the riches, too, will soon be made ducks and drakes of. Dear
me, how he squanders money!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. But how's it, dear, you've been so
simple to give up the money? It's yours.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. Ah, if you knew all! The
thing is that I've made one little mistake.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Well, if I were you, I'd go
straight and have the law of him. The money's yours; how dare he
squander it? There's no such rights.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya</i>. They don't pay heed to that
nowadays.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neighbor</i>. Ah, my dear, now I come to look at

That's, what d'you call it, it's cheating. You'd better find out,
or else they'll cheat you. Safe indeed! I mean you what d'ye call

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> I know nothing about it.
Iv&aacute;n Mos&eacute;vitch advised us at the time. "Put the money

interest," he said.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i> (<i>having finished his

like that. Put the money in the bank, then lie down on the oven and
it will keep coming in.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m.</i> That's queer talk. How's
that&mdash;what d'ye call, coming in, how's that coming in, and they,
who do they get it from I mean, the money I mean?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An&iacute;sya.</i> They take the money out of
the bank.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch.</i> Get along! Tain't a thing a
woman can understand! You look here, I'll make it all clear to you.
Mind and remember. You see, suppose you've got some money, and I,
for instance, have spring coming on, my land's idle, I've got no
seeds, or I have to pay taxes. So, you see, I go to you.
"Ak&iacute;m," I say, "give us a ten-rouble note, and when I've
harvested in autumn I'll return it, and till two acres for you
besides, for having obliged me!" And you, seeing I've something to
fall back on&mdash;a horse say, or a cow&mdash;you say, "No, give two or
three roubles for the obligation," and there's an end of it. I'm
stuck in the mud, and can't do without. So I say, "All right!" and
take a tenner. In the autumn, when I've made my turnover, I bring
it back, and you squeeze the extra three roubles out of me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i>. Yes, but that's what peasants
do when they what d'ye call it, when they forget God. It's not
honest, I mean, it's no good, I mean.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. You wait. You'll see it
comes just to the same thing. Now don't forget how you've skinned
me. And An&iacute;sya, say, has got some money lying idle. She does
not know what to do with it, besides, she's a woman, and does not
know how to use it. She comes to you. "Couldn't you make some
profit with my money too?" she says. "Why not?" say you, and you
wait. Before the summer I come again and say, "Give me another
tenner, and I'll be obliged." Then you find out if my hide isn't
all gone, and if I can be skinned again you give me An&iacute;sya's
money. But supposing I'm clean shorn,&mdash;have nothing to eat,&mdash;then
you see I can't be fleeced any more, and you say, "Go your way,
friend," and you look out for another, and lend him your own and
An&iacute;sya's money and skin him. That's what the bank is. So it
goes round and round. It's a cute thing, old fellow!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). Gracious me,
whatever is that like? It's what d'ye call it, it's filthy! The
peasants&mdash;what d'ye call it, the peasants do so I mean, and know
it's, what d'ye call it, a sin! It's what d'you call, not right,
not right, I mean. It's filthy! How can people as have learnt ...
what d'ye call it....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. That, old fellow, is just
what they're fond off And remember, them that are stupid, or the
women folk, as can't put their money into use themselves, they take
it to the bank, and they there, deuce take 'em, clutch hold of it,
and with this money they fleece the people. It's a cute thing!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i> (<i>sighing</i>). Oh dear, I
see, what d'ye call it, without money it's bad, and with money it's
worse! How's that? God told us to work, but you, what d'you call
... I mean you put money into the bank and go to sleep, and the
money will what d'ye call it, will feed you while you sleep. It's
filthy, that's what I call it; it's not right.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch.</i> Not right? Eh, old fellow,
who cares about that nowadays? And how clean they pluck you, too!
That's the fact of the matter.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Ak&iacute;m</i> (<i>sighs</i>). Ah, yes, seems
the time's what d'ye call it, the time's growing ripe. There, I've
had a look at the closets in town. What they've come to! It's all
polished and polished I mean, it's fine, it's what d'ye call it,
it's like inside an inn. And what's it all for? What's the good of
it? Oh, they've forgotten God. Forgotten, I mean. We've forgotten,

represents the interior of courtyard. The scenery at the back
shows, in the middle, the back porch of the hut. To the right the
winter half of the hut and the gate; to the left the summer half
and the cellar. To the right of the stage is a shed. The sound of
tipsy voices and shouts are heard from the hut</i><a name="d5-r">.</a>

out of the hut and beckons to</i> FIRST NEIGHBOR WOMAN.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Neighbor</i>. How's it Akoul&iacute;na
has not shown herself?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Neighbor</i>. Why hasn't she shown
herself? She'd have been glad to; but she's too ill, you know. The
suitor's relatives have come, and want to see the girl; and she, my
dear, she's lying in the cold hut and can't come out, poor
thing!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Neighbor</i>. But how's that?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Neighbor</i>. They say she's been
bewitched by an evil eye! She's got pains in the stomach!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Neighbor</i>. You don't say so?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Neighbor</i>. What else could it be?</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Whispers.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Neighbor</i>. Dear me! There's a go! But his
relatives will surely find it out?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Neighbor</i>. They find it out! They're
all drunk! Besides, they are chiefly after her dowry. Just think
what they give with the girl! Two furs, my dear, six dresses, a
French shawl, and I don't know how many pieces of linen, and money
as well,&mdash;two hundred roubles, it's said!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Neighbor</i>. That's all very well, but
even money can't give much pleasure in the face of such a
disgrace.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Neighbor</i>. Hush!... There's his father,
I think.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>They cease talking and go into the

awfully hot! Will just cool myself a bit. (<i>Stands puffing</i>.)
The Lord only knows what&mdash;something is not right. I can't feel
happy.&mdash;Well, it's the old woman's affair.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Enter</i> MATRY&Oacute;NA <i>from
hut.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. And I was just thinking,
where's the father? Where's the father? And here you are, dear
friend.... Well, dear friend, the Lord be thanked! Everything is as
honorable as can be! When one's arranging a match one should not
boast. And I have never learnt to boast. But as you've come about
the right business, so with the Lord's help, you'll be grateful to
me all your life! She's a wonderful girl! There's no other like her
in all the district!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Father.</i> That's true enough, but how
about the money?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> Don't you trouble about the
money! All she had from her father goes with her. And it's more
than one gets easily, as things are nowadays. Three times fifty
roubles!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Father.</i> We don't complain, but it's for
our own child. Naturally we want to get the best we can.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na.</i> I'll tell you straight,
friend: if it hadn't been for me, you'd never have found anything
like her! They've had an offer from the Karmilins, but I stood out
against it. And as for the money, I'll tell you truly: when her
father, God be merciful to his soul, was dying, he gave orders that
the widow should take Nik&iacute;ta into the homestead&mdash;of course I
know all about it from my son,&mdash;and the money was to go to
Akoul&iacute;na. Why, another one might have thought of his own
interests, but Nik&iacute;ta gives everything clean! It's no
trifle. Fancy what a sum it is!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Father.</i> People are saying that more
money was left her? The lad's sharp too!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Oh, dear soul alive! A
slice in another's hand always looks big; all she had will be
handed over. I tell you, throw doubts to the wind and make all
sure! What a girl she is! as fresh as a daisy!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Father</i>. That's so. But my old woman and
I were only wondering about the girl; why has she not come out?
We've been thinking, suppose she's sickly?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Ah, ah.... Who? She?
Sickly? Why, there's none to compare with her in the district. The
girl's as sound as a bell; you can't pinch her. But you saw her the
other day! And as for work, she's wonderful! She's a bit deaf,
that's true, but there are spots on the sun, you know. And her not
coming out, you see, it's from an evil eye! A spell's been cast on
her! And I know the bitch who's done the business! They know of the
betrothal and they bewitched her. But I know a counter-spell. The
girl will get up to-morrow. Don't you worry about the girl!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Father</i>. Well, of course, the thing's
settled.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Matry&oacute;na</i>. Yes, of course! Don't you
turn back. And don't forget me, I've had a lot of trouble. Don't
forget....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. But where did you find her? Do
tell!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Why, in their own house;
that's where! We came to a village, the soldiers began hunting
about in the house, when suddenly there's that same little girl
lying on the floor, flat on her stomach. We were going to give her
a knock on the head, but all at once I felt that sorry, that I took
her up in my arms; but no, she wouldn't let me! Made herself so
heavy, quite a hundredweight, and caught hold where she could with
her hands, so that one couldn't get them off! Well, so I began
stroking her head. It was so bristly,--just like a hedgehog! So I
stroked and stroked, and she quieted down at last. I soaked a bit
of rusk and gave it her. She understood that, and began nibbling.
What were we to do with her? We took her; took her, and began
feeding and feeding her, and she got so used to us that we took her
with us on the march, and so she went about with us. Ah, she was a
fine girl!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Yes, and not baptized?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Who can tell! They used to
say, not altogether. 'Cos why, those people weren't our own.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Germans?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. What an idea! Germans! Not
Germans, but Asiatics. They are just the same as Jews, but still
not Jews. Polish, yet Asiatics. Curls ... or, Curdlys is their
name.... I've forgotten what it <a name="d8-r">is!</a><sup><a href="#d8">8</a></sup>
We called the girl S&aacute;shka. She was a fine girl,
S&aacute;shka was! There now, I've forgotten everything I used to
know! But that girl&mdash;the deuce take her&mdash;seems to be before my eyes
now! Out of all my time of service, I remember how they flogged me,
and I remember that girl. That's all I remember! She'd hang round
one's neck, and one 'ud carry her so. That was a girl,&mdash;if you
wanted a better you'd not find one! We gave her away afterwards.
The captain's wife took her to bring up as her daughter. So&mdash;she
was all right! How sorry the soldiers were to let her go!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. There now, daddy, and I remember when
father was dying,&mdash;you were not living with us then. Well, he
called Nik&iacute;ta and says, "Forgive me, Nik&iacute;ta!" he
says, and begins to cry. (<i>Sighs</i>.) That also felt very
sad!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Yes; there now, so it
is....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Daddy! Daddy, I say! There they are
again, making a noise in the cellar! Oh gracious heavens! Oh dear!
Oh dear! Oh, daddy! They'll do something to it! They'll make away
with it, and it's so little! Oh, oh!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Well, what now?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. The other day a traveller stayed the
night; he said that when an infant died its soul goes up straight
to heaven. Is that true?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Who can tell? I suppose so.
Well?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Oh, it would be best if I died too.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Whimpers.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Then you'd be off the

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Up to ten one's an infant, and maybe
one's soul would go to God. Else one's sure to go to the bad!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. And how to the bad? How
should the likes of you not go to the bad? Who teaches you? What do
you see? What do you hear? Only vileness! I, though I've not been
taught much, still know a thing or two. I'm not quite like a
peasant woman. A peasant woman, what is she? Just mud! There are
many millions of the likes of you in Russia, and all as blind as
moles&mdash;knowing nothing! All sorts of spells: how to stop the
cattle-plague with a plough, and how to cure children by putting
them under the perches in the hen-house! That's what they know!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Yes, mother also did that!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Yes,&mdash;there it is,&mdash;just
so! So many millions of girls and women, and all like beasts in a
forest! As she grows up, so she dies! Never sees anything; never
hears anything. A peasant,&mdash;he may learn something at the pub, or
maybe in prison, or in the army,&mdash;as I did. But a woman? Let alone
about God, she doesn't even know rightly what Friday it is! Friday!
Friday! But ask her what's Friday? She don't know! They're like
blind puppies, creeping about and poking their noses into the
dungheap.... All they know are their silly songs. Ho, ho, ho, ho!
But what they mean by ho-ho, they don't know themselves!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. But I, daddy, I do know half the Lord's
Prayer!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. A lot you know! But what
Can one expect of you? Who teaches you? Only a tipsy peasant&mdash;with
the strap perhaps! That's all the teaching you get! I don't know
who'll have to answer for you. For a recruit, the drill-sergeant or
the corporal has to answer; but for the likes of you there's no one
responsible! Just as the cattle that have no herdsman are the most
mischievous, so with you women&mdash;you are the stupidest class! The
most foolish class is yours!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nan</i>. Then what's one to do?</p>

you go away! <i>M&iacute;tritch</i>. Where should I go to? Climb
up, climb up! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! Holy Mother!... How they

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="hang"><i>In front of scene a stack-stand, to the left a
thrashing ground, to the right a barn. The barn doors are open.
Straw is strewn about in the doorway. The hut with yard and
out-buildings is seen in the background, whence proceed sounds of
singing and of a tambourine. Two</i> GIRLS <i>are walking past the
barn towards the hut.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. There, you see we've managed to
pass without so much as getting our boots dirty! But to come by the
street is terribly muddy! (<i>Stop and wipe their boots on the
straw.</i> FIRST GIRL <i>looks at the straw and sees something</i>
.) What's that?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Girl</i> (<i>looks where the straw lies
and sees some one</i>). It's M&iacute;tritch, their laborer. Just
look how drunk he is!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. Why, I thought be didn't
drink.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Girl</i>. It seems he didn't, until it
was going around. <i>First Girl</i>. Just see! He must have come to
fetch some straw. Look! he's got a rope in his hand, and he's
fallen asleep.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Girl</i> (<i>listening</i>). They're
still singing the <a name="d9-r">praises.</a><sup><a href="#d9">9</a>
</sup> So I s'pose the bride and bridegroom have not yet
been blessed! They say Akoul&iacute;na didn't even
<a name="d10-r">lament!</a><sup><a href="#d10">10</a></sup></p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. Mammie says she is marrying
against her will. Her stepfather threatened her, or else she'd not
have done it for the world! Why, you know what they've been saying
about her?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i> (<i>catching up the</i>
GIRLS). How d'you you do, lassies?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Girls</i>. How d'you do?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. Going to the wedding, my
dears?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. It's nearly over! We've come
just to have a look.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. Would you call my old man for
me? Simon, from Zo&uacute;evo; but surely you know him?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. To be sure we do; he's a
relative of the bridegroom's, I think?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. Of course; he's my old man's
nephew, the bridegroom is.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Girl</i>. Why don't you go yourself?
Fancy not going to a wedding!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. I have no mind for it, and no
time either. It's time for us to be going home. We didn't mean to
come to the wedding. We were taking oats to town. We only stopped
to feed the horse, and they made my old man go in.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. Where did you put up then? At
Fy&oacute;doritch's?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. Yes. Well then, I'll stay
here and you go and call him, my dear&mdash;my old man. Call him, my
pet, and say "Your missis, Mar&iacute;na, says you must go now!"
His mates are harnessing.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Girl</i>. Well, all right&mdash;if you won't go
in yourself.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>The</i> GIRLS <i>go away towards the house
along a footpath. Sounds of songs and tambourine.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i> (<i>alone, stands
thinking</i>). I might go in, but I don't like to, because I have
not met him since that day he threw me over. It's more than a year
now. But I'd have liked to have a peep and see how he lives with
his An&iacute;sya. People say they don't get on. She's a coarse
woman, and with a character of her own. I should think he's
remembered me more than once. He's been caught by the idea of a
comfortable life and has changed me for it. But, God help him, I
don't cherish ill-will! Then it hurt! Oh dear, it was pain! But now
it's worn away and been forgotten. But I'd like to have seen him.
(<i>Looks towards hut and sees</i> NIK&Iacute;TA.) Look there! Why,
he is coming here! Have the girls told him? How's it he has left
his guests? I'll go away! (NIK&Iacute;TA <i>approaches, hanging his
head down, swinging his arms, and muttering</i>.) And how sullen he
looks!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i> (<i>sees and recognises
MAR&Iacute;NA</i>). Mar&iacute;na, dearest friend, little
Mar&iacute;na, what do you want?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. I have come for my old
man.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. Why didn't you come to the
wedding? You might have had a look round, and a laugh at my
expense!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. What have I to laugh at? I've
come for my husband.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. Ah, Mar&iacute;na dear!</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Tries to embrace her.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i> (<i>steps angrily aside</i>).
You'd better drop that sort of thing, Nik&iacute;ta! What has been
is past! I've come for my husband. Is he in your house?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. So I must not remember the
past? You won't let me?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. It's no use recalling the
past! What used to be is over now!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. And can never come back, you
mean?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. And will never come back! But
why have you gone away? You, the master,&mdash;and to go away from the
feast!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i> (<i>sits down on the
straw</i>). Why have I gone away? Eh, if you knew, if you had any
idea.... I'm dull, Mar&iacute;na, so dull that I wish my eyes would
not see! I rose from the table and left them, to get away from the
people. If I could only avoid seeing any one!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i> (<i>coming nearer to him</i>).
How's that?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. This is how it is: when I
eat, it's there! When I drink, it's there! When I sleep, it's
there! I'm so sick of it&mdash;so sick! But it's chiefly because I'm all
alone that I'm so sick, Mar&iacute;na. I have no one to share my
trouble.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. You can't live your life
without trouble, Nik&iacute;ta. However, I've wept over mine and
wept it away.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. The former, the old trouble!
Ah, dear friend, you've wept yours away, and I've got mine up to
there!</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Puts his hand to his throat.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. But why?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. Why, I'm sick of my whole
life! I am sick of myself! Ah, Mar&iacute;na, why did you not know
how to keep me? You've ruined me, and yourself too! Is this
life?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i> (<i>stands by the barn crying,
but restrains herself</i>). I do not complain of my life,
Nik&iacute;ta! God grant every one a life like mine. I do not
complain. I confessed to my old man at the time, and he forgave me.
And he does not reproach me. I'm not discontented with my life. The
old man is quiet, and is fond of me, and I keep his children
clothed and washed! He is really kind to me. Why should I complain?
It seems God willed it so. And what's the matter with your life?
You are rich....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. My life!... It's only that I
don't wish to disturb the wedding feast, or I'd take this rope here
(<i>takes hold of the rope on the straw</i>) and throw it across
that rafter there. Then I'd make a noose and stretch it out, and
I'd climb on to that rafter and jump down with my head in the
noose! That's what my life is!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. That's enough! Lord help
you!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. You think I'm joking? You
think I'm drunk? I'm not drunk! To-day even drink takes no hold on
me! I'm devoured by misery! Misery is eating me up completely, so
that I care for nothing! Oh little Mar&iacute;na, it's only with
you I ever lived! Do you remember how we used to while away the
nights together at the railway?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. Don't you rub the sores,
Nik&iacute;ta! I'm bound legally now, and you too. My sin has been
forgiven, don't disturb...</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. What shall I do with my
heart? Where am I to turn to?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. What's there to be done?
You've got a wife. Don't go looking at others, but keep to your
own! You loved An&iacute;sya, then go on loving her!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. Oh, that An&iacute;sya, she's
gall and wormwood to me, but she's round my feet like rank
weeds!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Mar&iacute;na</i>. Whatever she is, still she's
your wife.... But what's the use of talking; you'd better go to
your visitors, and send my husband to me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nik&iacute;ta</i>. Oh dear, if you knew the

him in&mdash;a sofa had to be moved, during a
s&eacute;ance&mdash;and we forgot all about him. In all probability
he fell asleep. And, fancy, after our s&eacute;ance was over and

mediumistic phenomena in another part of the room, near the

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. That's just it. It comes to

has given us, let's say, the power of atturning, to enter, let's

the lawful amount.</p>

offered it to us last year. It comes to this, then, the whole sum
in full for the buying of the property of the land is 32,864
roubles.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. That's all
right, but how about paying up?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. As to the payment, the
Commune offers just as it was said last year&mdash;to pay in
'stalments, and your receipt of the ready money by lawful

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i> (<i>unwrapping a parcel of

selves rather than do such a thing just anyhow say, but in this
way, let's say, as it ought to be done.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. But did I
not write and tell you that I should not agree to it unless you
brought the whole sum?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. That's just it. It would be
more agreeable, but it is not in our possibilities, I mean.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. Well then,
the thing can't be done!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. The Commune, for example,
relied its hopes on that, that you made the offer last year to sell
it in easy 'stalments....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. That was
last year. I would have agreed to it then, but now I can't.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. But how's that? We've been
depending on your promise&mdash;we've got the papers ready and have

short of land; we'll say nothing about cattle, but even a hen,

<p class="indent">[<i>Bows.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. Of course
it's quite true, that I agreed last year to let you have the land
for payment by instalments, but now circumstances are such that it
would be inconvenient.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. Without this land we cannot
live!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. That's just it. Without land
our lives must grow weaker and come to a decline.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Yes? What is
it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i> (<i>shyly</i>). You have been a
second father to me, and I will open my heart before you as before
God.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Don't beat about
the bush, but come straight to the point.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. The point is ... well, the
point is, that Simon wants to marry me.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Is that it? I
thought I noticed....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. Well, why should I hide it? I
am an orphan, and you know yourself how matters are in these town
establishments. Every one comes bothering; there's that Gregory
Mih&aacute;ylitch, for instance, he gives me no peace. And also
that other one ... you know. They think I have no soul, and am only
here for their amusement.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Good girl, that's
right! Well, what then?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. Well, Simon wrote to his
father; and he, his father, sees me to-day, and says: "He's
spoilt"&mdash;he means his son. Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch
(<i>bows</i>), take the place of a father to me, speak to the old

<p class="hang">CURTAIN</p>

<h3>ACT II</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Evening of the same day. The scene represents
the interior of the servants' kitchen. The</i> PEASANTS <i>have
taken off their outer garments and sit drinking tea at the table,
and perspiring.</i> THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH <i>is smoking a cigar
at the other side of the stage. The discharged</i> COOK <i>is lying
on the brick oven, and is unseen during the early part of the
scene.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. My advice is,
don't hinder him! If it's his wish and hers, in Heaven's name, let
him do it. She is a good, honest girl. Never mind her being a bit
dressy; she can't help that, living in town: she is a good girl all
the same.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. Well, of course, if it is
his wish, let him! <i>He'll</i> have to live with her, not me. But
she's certainly uncommon spruce. How's one to take her into one's
hut? Why, she'll not let her mother-in-law so much as pat her on
the head.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. That does not
depend on the spruceness, but on character. If her nature is good,
she's sure to be docile and respectful.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. Ah, well, we'll have her if
the lad's bent on having her. After all, it's a bad job to live
with one as one don't care for. I'll consult my missus, and then
may Heaven bless them!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Then let's shake
hands on it!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. Well, it seems it will have
to come off.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. Eh, Zachary! fortune's
a-smiling on you! You've come to accomplish a piece of business,
and just see what a duchess of a daughter-in-law you've obtained.
All that's left to be done is to have a drink on it, and then it
will be all in order.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. That's not at all
necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>An awkward silence.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. I know something
of your way of life, too, you know. I am even thinking of
purchasing a bit of land, building a cottage, and working on the
land myself somewhere; maybe in your neighborhood.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. A very good thing, too.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. That's just it. When one has
got the money one can get all kinds of pleasure in the country.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i>. Say no more about it! Country
life let's say, is freer in every way, not like the town!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. There now, would
you let me join your Commune if I settled among you?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. Why not? If you stand drink
for the Elders, they'll accept you soon enough!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. And if you open a
public-house, for example, or an inn, why, you'd have such a life
you'd never need to die! You might live like a king, and no
mistake.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Well, we'll see. I
should certainly like to have a few quiet years in my old age.
Though my life here is good enough, and I should be sorry to leave.
Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch is an exceedingly kind-hearted
man.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. That's just it. But how about
our business? Is it possible that he is going to leave it without
any termination?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. He'd do it
willingly.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. It seems he's afraid of his
wife.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. It's not that he's
afraid, but they don't hit things off together.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i>. But you should try, father!
How are we to live else? We've so little land....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. We'll see what
comes of T&aacute;nya's attempt. She's taken the business into her
hands now!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i> (<i>takes a sip of tea</i>).
Father, be merciful. We've so little land. A hen, let's say, we've
no room for a hen, let alone the cattle.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. If the business
depended on me.... (<i>To</i> SECOND PEASANT.) Well, friend, so
we've done our bit of match-making! It's agreed then about
T&aacute;nya?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. I've given my word, and I'll
not go back on it without a good reason. If only our business
succeeds!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Just now Simon was called
upstairs from the front kitchen! The master and that other
bald-headed one who calls up spirits with him, ordered him to sit
down and take the place of Kaptch&iacute;tch!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. You don't say

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. What do you

with a lot of dogs! Let any one who likes do it, but I will never
agree to live among dogs!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. What dogs?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Coachman</i>. Three dogs have been sent into our
room by Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch! They've messed it all
over. They're whining, and if one comes near them they
bite&mdash;the devils! They'd tear you to pieces if you didn't
mind. I've a good mind to take a club and smash their legs for
them!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. But when did they
come?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Coachman</i>. Why, to-day, from the Dog Show;
the devil knows what kind they are, but they're an expensive sort.
Are we or the dogs to live in the coachmen's quarters? You just go
and ask!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. Yes, that will
never do. I'll go and ask about it.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Coachman</i>. They'd better be brought here to
Louk&eacute;rya.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i> (<i>angrily</i>). People have
to eat here, and you'd like to lock dogs in here! As it is....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Coachman</i>. And I've got the liveries, and the
sledge-covers and the harness there, and they expect things kept
clean! Perhaps the porter's lodge might do.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>. I must ask
Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Coachman</i> (<i>angrily</i>). He'd better hang
the brutes round his neck and lug them about with him! But no fear:
he'd rather ride on horseback himself. It's he as spoilt. Beauty
without rhyme or reason. That was a horse!... Oh, dear! what a

<p class="indent">[<i>Exit, slamming door.</i></p>

from the master's table.</p>

eat.</p>

mean about the food. We have wheat bread every Sunday, and fish
when a holiday happens to be a fast-day, too, and those who like
may eat meat.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. And does any one tuck into
flesh on fast-days?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Oh, they nearly all do! Only
the old coachman&mdash;not the one who was here just now but the
old one&mdash;and Simon, and I and the housekeeper, fast&mdash;all
the others eat meat.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. And the master himself?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Catch him! Why, I bet he's
forgotten there is such a thing as fasting!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i>. Oh, Lord!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. That's the gentlefolks' way:
they have got it all out of their books. 'Cos of their intelex!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i>. Shouldn't wonder if they feed
on wheat bread every day!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Wheat bread, indeed! Much
they think of wheat bread! You should see what food they eat. No
end of different things!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. In course gentlefolks' food
is of an airial kind.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Airial, of course, but all
the same they're good at stuffing themselves, they are!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. Have healthy appekites, so to
say.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. 'Cos they always rinse it
down! All with sweet wines, and spirits, and fizzy liquors. They
have a different one to suit every kind of food. They eat and rinse
it down, and eat and rinse it down, they do.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. And so the food's floated
down in proportion, so to say.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Ah, yes, they are good at
stuffing! It's awful! You see, it's not just sitting down, eating,
then saying grace and going away&mdash;they're always at it!</p>

samov&aacute;r emptied, a third has to be set. Then lunch, then
dinner, then again coffee. They've hardly left off, then comes tea,
and all sorts of tit-bits and sweetmeats&mdash;there's never an end

work?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Servants' Cook</i>. Work indeed! What is their
work? Cards and piano&mdash;that's all their work. The young lady
used to sit down to the piano as soon as she opened her eyes, and
off she'd go! And that other one who lives here, the teacher,
stands and waits. "When will the piano be free?" When one has
finished, off rattles the other, and sometimes they'd put two
pianos near one another and four of 'em would bust out at once.
Bust out in such a manner, you could hear 'em down here!</p>

Plough or mow,&mdash;I'm game. Those are things one doesn't

General's outside Moscow once: a cross, terrible proud old fellow
he was&mdash;just awful. Well, this General's daughter fell ill.
They send for that doctor at once. "A thousand roubles, then I'll
come." Well, they agreed, and he came. Then they did something or
other he didn't like, and he bawled out at the General and says,
"Is this the way you show your respect for me? Then I'll not attend
her!" And, oh, my! The old General forgot all his pride, and starts
wheedling him in every way not to chuck up the job!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>First Peasant</i>. And he got the thousand?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Jacob</i>. Of course!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Second Peasant</i>. That's easy got money. What
wouldn't a peasant do with such a sum!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant</i>. And I think it's all bosh.
That time my foot was festering I had it doctored ever so long. I
spent nigh on five roubles on it,&mdash;then I gave up doctoring,
and it got all right!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Grossman</i> (<i>wearily</i>). It was
hypnosis.</p>

entering an hypnogenetic zone.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i>. Granting that, it would

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. Hypnotism is a phenomenon

<p class="hang"><i>Grossman</i>. Charcot does not so define it.</p>

That is your definition, but Li&eacute;bault told me

temperature?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Fat Lady</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). No, allow
me! I agree with the Professor. And here's the very best proof.
After my illness, when I lay insensible, a desire to speak came
over me. In general I am of a silent disposition, but then I was
overcome by this desire to speak, and I spoke and spoke, and I was
told that I spoke in such a way that every one was astonished!
(<i>To</i> SAH&Aacute;TOF.) But I think I interrupted you?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). Not at
all. Pray continue.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Doctor</i>. Pulse 82, and the temperature has
risen three-tenths of a degree.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. There you are! That's a proof!
That's just as it should be. (<i>Takes out pocket-book and
writes</i>.) 82, yes? And 37 and 5. When the hypnotic state is
induced, it invariably produces a heightened action of the
heart.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Doctor</i>. I can, as a medical man, bear
witness that your prognosis was justified by the event.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>to SAH&Aacute;TOF</i>). You
were saying?...</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i>. I wished to say that
Li&eacute;bault told me himself that the hypnotic is only one
particular psychical state, increasing susceptibility to
suggestion.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. That is so, but still the law of
equivalents is the chief thing.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Grossman</i>. Moreover, Li&eacute;bault is far
from being an authority, while Charcot has studied the subject from
all sides, and has proved that hypnotism produced by a blow, a
trauma....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>All talking together&mdash;</i></p>

perfectly! And he turns out to be an exceptionally powerful
medium.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i> (<i>incredulously</i>). Dear
me!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. It turns
out that it has long been noticed in the servants' hall. When he
sits down to table, the spoon springs into his hand of its own
accord! (<i>To the</i> PROFESSOR.) Had you heard about it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. No, I had not heard that
detail.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i> (<i>to the</i> PROFESSOR).
But still, you admit the possibility of such phenomena?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. What phenomena?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i>. Well, spiritualistic,
mediumistic, and supernatural phenomena in general.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. The question is, what do we
consider supernatural? When, not a living man but a piece of stone
attracted a nail to itself, how did the phenomena strike the first
observers? As something natural? Or supernatural?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i>. Well, of course; but
phenomena such as the magnet attracting iron always repeat
themselves.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i>. It is just the same in this case.
The phenomenon repeats itself and we experiment with it. And not
only that, but we apply to the phenomena we are investigating the
laws common to other phenomena. These phenomena seem supernatural
only because their causes are attributed to the medium himself. But
that is where the mistake lies. The phenomena are not caused by the
medium, but by psychic energy acting through a medium, and that is
a very different thing. The whole matter lies in the law of
equivalents.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof</i>. Yes, certainly, but....</p>

now I mean business.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Betsy</i>. What? How? What business?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. Well, you see, those peasants
that came this morning, you saw them. They want to buy some land,
and your father won't sell it; well, and Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch,
he says it's the spirits as forbid him. So I have had a thought

<p class="hang"><i>Betsy</i>. Oh, I see! Well, you are a clever
girl! Do it, do it.... But how will you manage it?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. Well, I thought, when they put
out the lights, I'll at once begin knocking and shying things
about, touching their heads with the threads, and at last I'll take
the paper about the land and throw it on the table. I've got it
here.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Betsy</i>. Well, and then?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. Why, don't you see? They will

<p class="hang"><i>Betsy</i>. Why, of course! Simon is the medium
to-day!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>T&aacute;nya</i>. Well, I'll teach him....
(<i>Laughs so that she can't continue</i>.) I'll tell him to
squeeze with his hands any one he can get hold of! Of course, not
your father&mdash;he'd never dare do that&mdash;but any one else;
he'll squeeze till it's signed.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Betsy</i> (<i>laughing</i>). But that's not the

It is true I have studied hypnotism in all its known

unknown to me. When a subject is thrown into a trance, I may expect
the hypnotic phenomena known to me: lethargy, abulia, anaesthesia,
analgesia, catalepsy, and every kind of susceptibility to
suggestion. Here it is not these but other phenomena we expect to
observe. Therefore it would be well to know of what kind are the
phenomena we expect to witness, and what is their scientific
significance.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Simon</i>. Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>rising and addressing the</i>
FAT LADY&mdash;<i>then reseating himself</i>). Ladies and
gentlemen! The phenomenon we are investigating to-night is
regarded, on the one hand, as something new; and, on the other, as
something transcending the limits of natural conditions. Neither
view is correct. This phenomenon is not new but is as old as the
world; and it is not supernatural but is subject to the eternal
laws that govern all that exists. This phenomenon has been usually
defined as "intercourse with the spirit world." That definition is
inexact. Under such a definition the spirit world is contrasted
with the material world. But this is erroneous; there is no such
contrast! Both worlds are so closely connected that it is
impossible to draw a line of demarcation, separating the one from
the other. We say matter is composed of molecules....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Petr&iacute;stchef</i>. Prosy matter!</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Whispering and laughter.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>pauses, then continues</i>).
Molecules are composed of atoms, but the atoms, having no
extension, are in reality nothing but the points of application of
forces. Strictly speaking, not of forces but of energy, that same
energy which is as much a unity and just as indestructible as
matter. But matter, though one, has many different aspects, and the
same is true of energy. Till recently only four forms of energy,
convertible into one another, have been known to us: energies known
as the dynamic, the thermal, the electric, and the chemic. But
these four aspects of energy are far from exhausting all the
varieties of its manifestation. The forms in which energy may
manifest itself are very diverse, and it is one of these new and as
yet but little known phases of energy, that we are investigating
to-night. I refer to mediumistic energy.</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Renewed whispering and laughter among the
young people.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>stops and casts a severe look
round</i>). Mediumistic energy has been known to mankind for ages:
prophecy, presentiments, visions and so on, are nothing but
manifestations of mediumistic energy. The manifestations produced
by it have, I say, been known to mankind for ages. But the energy
itself has not been recognised as such till quite
recently&mdash;not till that medium, the vibrations of which cause
the manifestations of mediumistic energy, was recognised. In the
same way that the phenomena of light were inexplicable until the
existence of an imponderable substance&mdash;an ether&mdash;was
recognised, so mediumistic phenomena seemed mysterious until the
now fully established fact was recognised, that between the
particles of ether there exists another still more rarefied
imponderable substance not subject to the law of the three
dimensions....</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Renewed laughter, whispers, and
giggling.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>again looks round
severely</i>). And just as mathematical calculations have
irrefutably proved the existence of imponderable ether which gives
rise to the phenomena of light and electricity, so the successive
investigations of the ingenious Hermann, of Schmidt, and of Joseph
Schmatzhofen, have confirmed beyond a doubt the existence of a
substance which fills the universe and may be called spiritual
ether.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Fat Lady</i>. Ah, now I understand. I am so
grateful....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>. Yes, but
Alex&eacute;y Vlad&iacute;miritch, could you not ... condense it a
little?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>not heeding the remark</i>).
And so, as I have just had the honor of mentioning to you, a
succession of strictly scientific experiments have made plain to us
the laws of mediumistic phenomena. These experiments have proved
that, when certain individuals are plunged into a hypnotic state (a
state differing from ordinary sleep only by the fact that man's
physiological activity is not lowered by the hypnotic influence
but, on the contrary, is always heightened&mdash;as we have
recently witnessed), when, I say, any individual is plunged into
such a state, this always produces certain perturbations in the
spiritual ether&mdash;perturbations quite similar to those produced
by plunging a solid body into liquid matter. These perturbations
are what we call mediumistic phenomena....</p>

<p class="indent">[<i>Laughter and whispers.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sah&aacute;tof.</i> That is quite comprehensible
and correct; but if, as you are kind enough to inform us, the
plunging of the medium into a trance produces perturbations of the
spiritual ether, allow me to ask why (as is usually supposed to be
the case in spiritualistic s&eacute;ances) these perturbations
result in an activity on the part of the souls of dead people?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor.</i> It is because the molecules of
this spiritual ether are nothing but the souls of the living, the
dead, and the unborn, and any vibration of the spiritual ether must
inevitably cause a certain vibration of its atoms. These atoms are
nothing but human souls, which enter into communication with one
another by means of these movements.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Fat Lady</i> (<i>to</i> SAH&Aacute;TOF). What is
it that puzzles you? It is so simple.... Thank you so, so much!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch.</i> I think
everything has now been explained, and that we may commence.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Doctor.</i> The fellow is in a perfectly normal
condition: temperature 37 decimal 2, pulse 74.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>takes out his pocket-book and
notes this down</i>). What I have just had the honor of explaining
will be confirmed by the fact, which we shall presently have an
opportunity of observing, that after the medium has been thrown
into a trance his temperature and pulse will inevitably rise, just
as occurs in cases of hypnotism.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch.</i> Yes, yes.
But excuse me a moment. I should like to reply to Serg&eacute;y
Iv&aacute;nitch's question: How do we know we are in communication
with the souls of the dead? We know it because the spirit that
appears, plainly tells us&mdash;as simply as I am speaking to
you&mdash;who he is, and why he has come, and whether all is well
with him! At our last s&eacute;ance a Spaniard, Don Castillos, came
to us, and he told us everything. He told us who he was, and when
he died, and that he was suffering for having taken part in the
Inquisition. He even told us what was happening to him at the very
time that he was speaking to us, namely, that at the very time he
was talking to us he had to be born again on earth, and, therefore,
could not continue his conversation with us.... But you'll see for
yourselves....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Fat Lady</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Oh, how

is a baby now!</p>

those things, last night,&mdash;it was not Simon but T&aacute;nya

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> What is that? From
under the sofa?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Gregory.</i> I give you my word of honor. And it
was she who threw the paper on the table. If it had not been for
her the paper would not have been signed, nor the land sold to the
peasants.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> And you saw it
yourself?</p>

P&aacute;vlovna? How do you do, Miss Betsy? Leon&iacute;d
Fy&oacute;doritch, I have brought you a report of the Thirteenth
Congress of Spiritualists at Chicago. An amazing speech by
Schmidt!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch.</i> Oh, that is
interesting!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> I will tell you
something much more interesting! It turns out that both you and my
husband were fooled by this girl! Betsy takes it on herself, but
that is only to annoy me. It was an illiterate peasant girl who
fooled you, and you believed it all. There were no mediumistic
phenomena last night; it was she (<i>pointing to</i> T&Aacute;NYA)
who did it!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>taking off his overcoat</i>).
What do you mean?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> I mean that it was she
who, in the dark, played on the guitar and beat my husband on the
head and performed all your idiotic tricks&mdash;and she has just
confessed!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>smiling</i>). What does that
prove?</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> It proves that your
mediumism is&mdash;tomfoolery; that's what it proves!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor.</i> Because this young girl wished to
deceive, we are to conclude that mediumism is "tomfoolery," as you
are pleased to express it? (<i>Smiles</i>.) A curious conclusion!
Very possibly this young girl may have wished to deceive: that
often occurs. She may even have done something; but then, what she
did&mdash;<i>she</i> did. But the manifestations of mediumistic
energy still remain manifestations of <i>mediumistic</i> energy! It
is even very probable that what this young girl did evoked (and so
to say solicited) the manifestation of mediumistic
energy,&mdash;giving it a definite form.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i> Another lecture!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Professor</i> (<i>sternly</i>). You say, Anna
P&aacute;vlovna, that this girl, and perhaps this dear young lady
also, did something; but the light we all saw, and, in the first
case the fall, and in the second the rise of temperature, and
Grossman's excitement and vibration&mdash;were those things also
done by this girl? And these are facts, Anna P&aacute;vlovna,
facts! No! Anna P&aacute;vlovna, there are things which must be
investigated and fully understood before they can be talked about,
things too serious, too serious....</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch.</i> And the child that
M&aacute;rya Vas&iacute;levna distinctly saw? Why, I saw it too....
That could not have been done by this girl.</p>

wise, but you are&mdash;a fool.</p>

Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch! Let him give up the silver plate to you.
Be off, at once! It is all his fault! This man will bring me to my
grave. Last night he nearly starved the dog that had done him no
harm! And, as if that were not enough, he lets the infected
peasants into the kitchen, and now they are here again! It is all
his fault! Be off at once! Discharge him, discharge him! (<i>To</i>
SIMON.) And you, horrid peasant, if you dare to have rows in my
house again, I'll teach you!</p>

too, and there's an end of it.</p>

the house, and here they are again? Drive them out!</p>

accept their money?</p>

take their money; but they must be turned out at once, especially
this one! He is quite rotten!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Third Peasant.</i> That's not just, lady. God's
my witness, it's not just! You'd better ask my old woman, let's
say, whether I am rotten! I'm clear as crystal, let's say.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
